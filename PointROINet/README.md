1. Before running PointROINet, you need to install the environment in requirements.txt.

2. Data set preparation

The format of the data set is ShapeNet format and is located in the .data\shapenetcore_partanno_segmentation_benchmark_v0_normal folder

3. PointROINet training

Run the train_partseg.py file. The specific instructions are as follows:
python train_partseg.py --model ppointnet2_part_seg_msg --normal --log_dir pointnet2_part_seg_msg

4. Training results

The training results are located at .log\part_seg\pointnet2_part_seg_msg folder

5. PointROINet testing

Run the test_partseg_showweldpointcloud.py file. The specific instructions are as follows:
python test_partseg_showweldpointcloud.py --normal --log_dir pointnet2_part_seg_msg

6. Test results

The test results are located in the log\part_seg\pointnet2_part_seg_msg\eval.txt file
